## Course Overview
CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python, offered by Harvard University, dives into the core ideas behind technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through lectures and 13 programming projects, students learn to design intelligent systems by implementing AI algorithms in Python. The course covers topics such as graph search, optimization, reinforcement learning, neural networks, and natural language processing, equipping learners to solve real-world problems with AI.

## Projects
This repository contains my solutions to the following 13 projects from the course:
### 0. Degrees
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Breadth-first search (BFS), graph algorithms, Python data structures (dictionaries, sets, queues)
- **Description:** Determines the shortest path (degrees of separation) between two actors by connecting them through movies they starred in, based on the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" concept. The program uses BFS to find the shortest sequence of movies linking the actors.
### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Minimax algorithm, adversarial search, recursion
- **Description:** Implements an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally, evaluating all possible future moves to select the best one using the Minimax algorithm. The AI ensures it never loses and wins whenever possible.
### 2. Knights
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Propositional logic, knowledge representation, logical inference
- **Description:** Solves logic puzzles involving knights (who always tell the truth) and knaves (who always lie) by encoding statements as a knowledge base and using logical inference to deduce identities.
### 3. Minesweeper
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Knowledge-based agents, logical inference, probability
- **Description:** Creates an AI to play Minesweeper by reasoning about safe cells and mines based on clues. The agent uses logical deductions to make informed moves or relies on probability when uncertainty remains.
### 4. PageRank
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Bayesian networks, Markov models, probability theory
- **Description:** Simulates Google’s PageRank algorithm to rank web pages based on their link structure. The AI calculates the importance of pages using iterative probability distributions.
### 5. Heredity
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Bayesian networks, probability theory
- **Description:** Models genetic inheritance to predict the probability of a child inheriting a trait based on parental genetics, using Bayesian networks to compute joint probabilities.
### 6. Crossword
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), backtracking search, arc-consistency
- **Description:** Generates a crossword puzzle by placing words according to given constraints, using backtracking and constraint propagation to ensure a valid solution.
### 7. Shopping
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Supervised learning, scikit-learn, classification
- **Description:** Builds a machine learning model to predict whether online shoppers will complete a purchase based on their browsing behavior, using classification techniques and scikit-learn’s tools.
### 8. Nim
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Reinforcement learning, Q-learning
- **Description:** Develops an AI agent that learns to play the game of Nim optimally through reinforcement learning, improving its strategy with Q-learning over multiple games.
### 9. Traffic
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), TensorFlow, deep learning
- **Description:** Trains a convolutional neural network to classify German traffic signs from the GTSRB dataset, using TensorFlow for image recognition.
### 10. Parser
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Natural language processing (NLP), probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG), NLTK
- **Description:** Implements a parser that extracts noun phrases from sentences using a probabilistic context-free grammar, leveraging NLTK for natural language processing.
### 11. Questions
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Natural language processing, information retrieval, TF-IDF
- **Description:** Creates an AI that answers factual questions by searching a text corpus, using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to identify relevant information.

## Key Technologies and Libraries
- **Python :** The primary programming language for all projects, providing a flexible and powerful environment for AI development.
- **NumPy:** Used for numerical computations, array operations, and matrix manipulations, especially in projects like PageRank and Heredity.
- **TensorFlow:** Employed for building and training deep learning models, notably in the Traffic project for convolutional neural networks.
- **scikit-learn:** Utilized for supervised learning tasks, such as classification in the Shopping project.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Applied in the Parser project for natural language processing tasks like tokenization and grammar parsing.
